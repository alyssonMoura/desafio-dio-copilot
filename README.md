# Credit Card Validator Project

This project was developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, focusing on creating a credit card validator application using TypeScript and Jest for testing.

## Project Development Conversation

### Initial Setup Request
**User:** Requested to create a Node.js environment using only devcontainer without Dockerfile, configured with TypeScript and Jest unit tests. The project should include a credit card brand identifier based on the card number, using validation criteria from 4devs.com.br.

### Setup Process
1. Created devcontainer configuration
   - Set up Node.js TypeScript development environment
   - Configured VS Code extensions for ESLint and Prettier
   - Added post-creation command for npm install

2. Project Configuration Files
   - Created package.json with necessary dependencies and scripts
   - Set up TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
   - Configured Jest for testing (jest.config.js)

### Next Steps
The project is ready to be reopened in a devcontainer environment for further development of the credit card validation functionality.

## Project Features (To Be Implemented)
- Credit card brand identification (Visa, MasterCard, etc.)
- Validation based on card number patterns
- Unit tests for each supported card brand
